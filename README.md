## Resize vRA VM

I have updated this as a single monolith script due to the necessity for resizing VMs exclusively. I'm keeping it as it is since I no longer find it interesting. However, this script can be forked and developed using object-oriented concepts, which would enhance the manageability of VMs at a faster pace.
